# country-info


</br>
Country Info SPA is been created to allow users to search for a nation and find it pipointed on a map, with various info from the nation and the flag representing it.

</br>
We found a potentially useful amount of data on nations and worked it to our needs. We then started the server side of the project with node dependencies and mongoose, adding express and uploaded on our MondoDb databes to able to have it stored at use.
<br/>
We created a React.js frontend implementing with [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-maps "React Google Maps" giving us the base for the project
After creating context and states we started adding our components.

We then refactored ode and aded CSS, to then merge all of our work together.
